## Node

- Node : A machine that is running an Ethereum client machine.
- Networks : Networks are formed by one or more nodes.
- Transaction : Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another.
- Block : Group of Transactions. 
- BlockChain : A database that stores a record of every transaction. And it's also where we store data in the form of a chain of Blocks(hence The Name).
- EVM : The EVM’s physical instantiation can’t be described in the same way that one might point to a cloud or an ocean wave, but it does exist as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum client.
- Private Key : A private key is made up of 64 hex characters and can be encrypted with a password.
- Public Key : The public key is generated from the private key using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.
- Account : An Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum. Accounts can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts.
- Metamask : Browser Extension to interact with the Ethereum network through Mnemonic generated accounts.
- Gas : Gas is essential to the Ethereum network. It is the fuel that allows it to operate, in the same way that a car needs gasoline to run.
- Smart Contract : A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
