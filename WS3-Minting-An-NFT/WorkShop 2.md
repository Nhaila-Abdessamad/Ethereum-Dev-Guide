## Installing Nodejs npm and Git
- Normal dev Environement Preparation.

## Tools Used:
1. Truffle
2. Ganache
3. Ifura
4. Mocha

## Contract Deployment
- There is multiple ways to deploy a contract:
- Deployment Process:
 1. compilation of the contract source by a solidity compiler (SC).
 2. The SC spits out an ABI & the contract byteCode.
 3. This ByteCode is what ends up deployed to some Network.
- This section is about creation of a custom node Project that represents a light version of the truffle Library.
