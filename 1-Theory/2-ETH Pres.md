## What Is Ethereum?
- when we work with Ethereum, we are working with a network of computers.
- These networks are used to transfer money between different parties like you and me, and they're also
used to store data.
- there are many different Ethereum networks.
- there's one main Ethereum network that everyone uses for deployment of production applications.
- There are test networks.
- You can even create your own private Ethereum network on your own computer that is restricted to just you.
- Networks are formed by one or more nodes.
- anyone can run a node
- Each Node can contain a full copy of the BlockChain.


## Interfacing With Ethereum Networks
- Developers Interact with ETH network through Web.js 
- Normal Users(Cutomers) Interact with the network through Metamask.
