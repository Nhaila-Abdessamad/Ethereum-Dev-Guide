## REMIX
- Remix IDE is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs.
-  Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as act as a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.
-  Remix IDE is part of the Remix Project which is a platform for development tools that use a plugin architecture.
-  It encompasses sub-projects including Remix Plugin Engine, Remix Libs, and of course Remix-IDE.
-  Remix IDE is a powerful open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser.
-  It is written in JavaScript and supports both usage in the browser, but run locally and in a desktop version.
-  Remix IDE has modules for testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.

## SOLIDITY
- Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. 
- Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
- Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
- It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript.

## METAMASK
- MetaMask allows users to manage accounts and their keys in a variety of ways, including hardware wallets, while isolating them from the site context.
- This is a great security improvement over storing the user keys on a single central server, or even in local storage, which can allow for mass account thefts.
- This security feature also comes with developer convenience: For developers, you simply interact with the globally available ethereum API that identifies the users of web3-compatible browsers (like MetaMask users).
- and whenever you request a transaction signature (like eth_sendTransaction, eth_signTypedData, or others), MetaMask will prompt the user in as comprehensible a way as possible.
- This keeps users informed, and leaves attackers only the option of trying to phish individual users, rather than performing mass hacks.

## ETHERSCAN
- Etherscan is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for Ethereum, a decentralized smart contracts platform.
- Etherscan community Developed APIs to empower developers with direct access to Etherscan's block explorer data and services via GET/POST requests.

## WEB3

## TRUFFLE 
- world-class development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.

## GANACHE 
-  It is a locally deployed Blockchain simulator. Ganache features a graphical user interface that can simulate Blockchain networks and live-test Smart Contracts without requiring you to set up real test networks or using a remote network.   

## DRIZZLE
-  It is an assortment of front-end libraries that offer useful components for developing web applications that can seamlessly connect with the Smart Contracts.
