## Smart Contract Definition 
- A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain..
- It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account.
- This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network.
- However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed.
- User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract.
- Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code.
- Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.
