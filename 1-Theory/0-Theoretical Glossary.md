## Node

 A machine that is running an Ethereum client machine.

## Networks

Networks are formed by one or more nodes.

## EVM
 The EVM’s physical instantiation can’t be described in the same way that one might point to a cloud or an ocean wave, but it does exist as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum client.

## Block
 Group of Transactions..

## BlockChain
 A database that stores a record of every transaction. And it's also where we store data in the form of a chain of Blocks(hence The Name).

## Account
An Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum. Accounts can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts.

## Smart Contract
A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Private Key 
A private key is made up of 64 hex characters and can be encrypted with a password.

## Public Key 

 The public key is generated from the private key using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.

## Transaction
 Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another.

## Gas
 Gas is a fee required by every transaction. It pays the computing power necessary for validation & Mining.
