## Glossary

- Node : A machine that is running an Ethereum client machine.
- Networks : Networks are formed by one or more nodes.
- Transaction : Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another.
- Block : Group of Transactions. 
- BlockChain : A database that stores a record of every transaction. And it's also where we store data in the form of a chain of Blocks(hence The Name).
- Private Key : A private key is made up of 64 hex characters and can be encrypted with a password.
- Public Key : The public key is generated from the private key using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.
- Account : An Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum. Accounts can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts.
- Metamask : Browser Extension to interact with the Ethereum network through Mnemonic generated accounts.
- Gas : Gas is essential to the Ethereum network. It is the fuel that allows it to operate, in the same way that a car needs gasoline to run.
- Smart Contract : A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.


## Short History
- BTC Paper - 2008 (BlockChain Technology for money Transfer Only) (Went Online in 2009)
- Ethereum white Paper - 2013 (Creation complex applications on top of BlockChain Technology) (Went Online in 2015)
- "ETH White Paper" discusses need for more programatic control over Transactions.
- Wanted to enable creation of Desentralised Autonumous Corporations (DAC).
- Introduces the Idea of 'smart contracts' as an entity that can send and receive currency beyond just humans. 


## What Is Ethereum?
- when we work with Ethereum, we are working with a network of computers.
- These networks are used to transfer money between different parties like you and me, and they're also
used to store data.
- there are many different Ethereum networks.
- there's one main Ethereum network that everyone uses for deployment of production applications.
- There are test networks.
- You can even create your own private Ethereum network on your own computer that is restricted to just you.
- Networks are formed by one or more nodes.
- anyone can run a node
- Each Node can contain a full copy of the BlockChain.


## Interfacing With Ethereum Networks
- Developers Interact with ETH network through Web.js 
- Normal Users(Cutomers) Interact with the network through Metamask.
