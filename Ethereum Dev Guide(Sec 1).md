## Glossary

- Node : A machine that is running an Ethereum client machine.
- Networks : Networks are formed by one or more nodes.
- Transaction : 
- Block : Group of Transactions. 
- BlockChain : a database that stores a record of every transaction. And it's also where we store data in the form of a chain of Blocks(hence The Name).
- Smart Contract : 


## Short History
- BTC Paper - 2008 (BlockChain Technology for money Transfer Only) (Went Online in 2009)
- Ethereum white Paper - 2013 (Creation complex applications on top of BlockChain Technology) (Went Online in 2015)
- "ETH White Paper" discusses need for more programatic control over Transactions.
- Wanted to enable creation of Desentralised Autonumous Corporations (DAC).
- Introduces the Idea of 'smart contracts' as an entity that can send and receive currency beyond just humans. 


## What Is Ethereum?
- when we work with Ethereum, we are working with a network of computers.
- These networks are used to transfer money between different parties like you and me, and they're also
used to store data.
- there are many different Ethereum networks.
- there's one main Ethereum network that everyone uses for deployment of production applications.
- There are test networks.
- You can even create your own private Ethereum network on your own computer that is restricted to just you.
- Networks are formed by one or more nodes.
- anyone can run a node
- Each Node can contain a full copy of the BlockChain.
